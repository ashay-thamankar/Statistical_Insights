# Regression Analysis - Second-Hand Cars

## Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the price of used cars based on various specifications or regressors, including brand, mileage, engine volume, and year of production. Understanding how these factors influence the price of second-hand cars is invaluable for both buyers and sellers in the used car market.

## Components

### Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis includes second-hand cars with the following attributes:
- Brand
- Price
- Mileage
- Engine Volume
- Year of Production

### Potential Regressors

1. **Brand:** Different car brands have different price ranges. For instance, a BMW is generally more expensive than a Toyota.

2. **Mileage:** The more a car is driven, the cheaper it should be, assuming other factors are constant.

3. **Engine Volume:** Sports cars tend to have larger engines, which often affects the price. On the other hand, economy cars typically have smaller engines.

4. **Year of Production:** Generally, older cars are cheaper, with the exception of vintage or collectible vehicles.

## Multivariable Regression

We employed multivariable regression to predict the price of used cars. The equation for our multivariable regression model is as follows:

**Price = β0 + β1 * Brand + β2 * Mileage + β3 * Engine Volume + β4 * Year of Production + ɛ**

- **Price:** The predicted price of the used car.

- **Brand:** A numerical representation of the car's brand.

- **Mileage:** The total mileage driven by the car.

- **Engine Volume:** The engine volume of the car.

- **Year of Production:** The year the car was manufactured.

- **β0, β1, β2, β3, β4:** The coefficients that the model estimates for each of these variables. They represent the impact of each variable on the car's price.

- **ɛ:** The error term representing the variance not explained by the model.

The coefficients (β0, β1, β2, β3, β4) indicate the strength and direction of the relationship between each variable and the car's price. A positive coefficient means an increase in the variable is associated with a higher price, while a negative coefficient means the opposite.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Cleaning:** We clean the dataset to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.

2. **Regression Assumptions:** Before running the regression analysis, we validate the assumptions underlying linear regression.

3. **Log Transformation:** We perform log transformation on the relevant variables if needed to meet the assumptions of linear regression.

4. **Create and Evaluate Models:** We build and evaluate regression models to predict the price of used cars based on the selected regressors.

## Conclusion

The insights gained from this regression analysis can be used by both buyers and sellers in the second-hand car market to make informed decisions regarding pricing and purchasing. This project provides a foundation for understanding how various factors influence the pricing of used cars.
