Salary Analysis at Spark Fortress Inc.

Project Overview
-----------------
This project analyzes salary data from Spark Fortress Inc., a fictitious company with 5000+ employees. We examine 174 samples, focusing on the variables of name, gender, age, country, ethnicity, department, position, and salary. Our primary objective is to investigate whether a significant salary difference exists based on gender.

Hypotheses
-----------------
We define our null hypothesis (H0) and alternative hypothesis (H1) as follows:
- H0: Average male salary is equal to the average female salary.
- H1: Average male salary is not equal to the average female salary.

We employ a t-test for independent samples because the population variance is unknown and assumed to be equal.

Findings
-----------------
After conducting the statistical analysis, we discovered that the p-value is greater than common levels of significance. As a result, we cannot reject the null hypothesis, indicating insufficient statistical evidence for gender wage discrimination in the company.

Further Exploration
-----------------
To delve deeper into the issue, we divide the sample into two age groups: below 35 and above 35. Our analysis revealed that there is virtually no wage gap based on gender among younger employees. However, for the above-35 age group, we reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level, indicating the existence of a wage gap among older employees.

Limitations
-----------------
It's important to note that this analysis omitted essential factors such as position and ethnicity, which could affect salary discrepancies.

Racial Disparities
-----------------
Further exploring the data, we categorize employees into 'White' (containing only employees indicated as white) and 'Nonwhite' (comprising Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic, Two or more races). We found no significant pay gap based on race, with the results being insignificant.

Conclusion
-----------------
In summary, our analysis concludes that there is no wage gap in Spark Fortress Inc., particularly driven by younger employees. The company is making significant strides towards achieving pay equality.

This analysis should be interpreted within the context of the provided data and may not necessarily reflect real-world scenarios.
