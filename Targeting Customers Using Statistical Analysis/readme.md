# Star Real Estate California Database

## Introduction

This project focuses on the fictitious Star Real Estate California Database, which contains two main tables: "Product" and "Customer." The "Product" table stores information about properties, and when a product is sold, the corresponding data is added to the "Customer" table.

## Data Description

### Customer Table
- Customer ID
- Entity
- Name
- Age at the time of purchase
- Interval
- Gender
- Country
- Mortgage
- Source

### Product Table
- ID
- Building
- Year of sale
- Month of sale
- Type of property
- Area (sq. ft.)
- Price
- Status

## Analysis

### Gender Analysis
- Most customers are males, but this may be biased due to the data collection process.

### Location Analysis
- The majority of customers are from California, indicating the importance of focusing on this region.

### Age Analysis
- The analysis shows that customers aged between 26 and 65 make up 87% of the observations.
- Customers between the ages of 36 and 45 tend to purchase properties the most.
- There is no significant relationship between age and price.

### Price and Area Analysis
- Price and area are closely correlated.

## Conclusions

1. Males are more likely to sign contracts, suggesting they may be a better target audience for ads (though this is unclear).
2. 68% of sales are from California, with other states forming the rest of the customer base.
3. The majority of sales occur among customers aged between 26 and 55.
4. There is no clear relationship between the age of a customer and the price they are willing to pay for a property.

This analysis provides valuable insights for targeting potential customers and making data-driven decisions.
